          <p>
            <strong>Nutrius</strong> was created because too many athletes were
            given generic diet plans and rehab programs that didn’t match their
            sport, body, or lifestyle.
          </p>

          <p class="mt-3">
            <strong>
              “Training challenges the body. Nutrition repairs it. Recovery
              transforms it.”
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            The human body is a powerful system designed for movement, strength,
            and adaptation. For athletes, performance depends not only on
            training but on how well the body is fueled and cared for. Proper
            nutrition provides the energy to train, the building blocks to
            repair muscles, and the support needed for recovery and injury
            prevention. When training, nutrition, and rest work together, the
            body becomes stronger, more efficient, and capable of reaching its
            full potential.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 font-bold">
            Each vitamin has a specific job in the body. Vitamin D helps absorb
            calcium for strong bones, Vitamin C supports healing and immunity,
            and Vitamin B12 supports nerve function and energy production.
            Without enough vitamins, the body cannot perform efficiently.
            <p class="font-semibold mt-3">On the other hand :</p>
           <p class="mt-4 font-bold"> Minerals work as building blocks and regulators inside the body.
            Calcium strengthens bones and teeth, iron helps carry oxygen in the
            blood for energy and endurance, and magnesium supports muscle
            movement and relaxation. Potassium and sodium maintain fluid balance
            and proper nerve signals, especially during exercise. Together,
            minerals help the body stay strong, energized, and balanced.
             <strong>like thme all the other vitamins ande minareles ande enzime have specific roll in our body </strong></p>
